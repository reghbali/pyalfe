# Installation

PyALFE supports Linux x86-64, Mac x86-64, and Mac arm64 and requires python >= 3.9.

### Prerquisite
PyALFE uses [Greedy](https://greedy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) registration tool by default. The instruction for installing Greedy can be found [here](https://greedy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#using-pre-compiled-binaries).

Alternatively, PyALFE can be configured to use [AntsPy](https://antspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/registration.html) registration tool. To use AntsPy, you can install PyALFE with [ants support](#extras).

```bash
pip install pyalfe
